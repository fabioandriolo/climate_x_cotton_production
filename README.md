How climatology affects cotton production in the largest Brazilian producing municipalities

This work is based on two Brazilian public databases: the time series of cotton production in the municipalities and the time series of rainfall recorded by meteorological stations.

From the various cotton producing municipalities, the ten largest producers were selected.

These 10 municipalities were geolocated and compared with the geolocation of the nearest meteorological stations.

The Engle-Granger test was used to assess the causality of rainfall on cotton production.

Obviously we need to process the series data to fit this purpose.
